We will be selling bulk LEGO in 1 lb. bags. According to LEGO selling guide
Links to an external site., the more organized the bricks are the better they will sell. While most eBayers take a couple of photos and list the number of pounds to sell their project, we will be selling our bags of LEGO with data visualizations. If you would like more details about each brick you can find them at BrickLink.

## The Challenge

We will record information on the first 100 LEGO bricks in our bag (such as color).  Then, use the recorded data to create data visualizations to promote the product. The visualizations should provide an accurate description of the LEGOs without the customers handling or seeing the product (no pictures of LEGO's bags).

Data visualizations should also answer questions the buyers might have. Some example questions are listed below.

    How many slanted bricks do you have?
    What is the distribution of colors available in your set?
    What is the total area by color?

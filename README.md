We will be selling bulk LEGO in 1 lb. bags. According to LEGO selling guide
Links to an external site., the more organized the bricks are the better they will sell. While most eBayers take a couple of photos and list the number of pounds to sell their project, we will be selling our bags of LEGO with data visualizations. If you would like more details about each brick you can find them at BrickLink.

## The Challenge

We will record information on the first 100 LEGO bricks in our bag (such as color).  Then, use the recorded data to create data visualizations to promote the product. The visualizations should provide an accurate description of the LEGOs without the customers handling or seeing the product (no pictures of LEGO's bags).

Data visualizations should also answer questions the buyers might have. Some example questions are listed below.

    How many slanted bricks do you have?
    What is the distribution of colors available in your set?
    What is the total area by color?

## Results

There are 100 LEGO bricks in this bulk. It is essential to know how many bricks of each color are contained in the bulk. The following bar chart will allow the user to better decide if he/she need this bulk, or if she/he needs other bulk with more bricks of a different color (e.g. blue bricks).

This chart will display and separate all the bricks of the bulk. The criteria is, does the brick have a letter, logo or number? Users will find useful to have bricks without any of these elements on them.

This heat map will display the slanted bricks with their corresponding color. The higher the saturation the higher amount of slanted bricks of that color.
